Hi. I'm a senior Blockchain and Full-Stack developer who likes to work with Blockchain(Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solidity, ERC20, ERC721, ERC1155), JavaScript/Typescript (React, Angular, Vue.js, TensorFlow.js, Node, Nest), Python among others. Since I've graduated the university, I’ve joined several companies and dev teams to build web and defi apps.

Nowadays I passionate about blockchain technologies so that I'm mainly focusing on the Defi development stack.
